print "Give me a word: "
word = gets.chomp.downcase

# convoluted way that only sorta works:

if word[0] == "a" || word[0] == "e" || word[0] == "i" || word[0] == "o" || word[0] == "u"
	pl_word = word + "way"
else
	#word[0] = consonant
	if word[1] != "a" || word[1] != "e" || word[1] != "i" || word[1] != "o" || word[1] != "u"
		pl_word = word[2..word.length-1] + word[0..1] + "ay"
	else
		pl_word = word[1..word.length-1] + word[0] + "ay"
	end
end

puts "Ah, you mean '#{pl_word}'!"

# Much easier way using .include? that does work:

vowels = "aeiou"
consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"

if vowels.include?(word[0])
	pl_word = word + "way"
else
	#word[0] = consonant
	if consonants.include?(word[1])
		pl_word = word[2..word.length-1] + word[0..1] + "ay"
	else
		pl_word = word[1..word.length-1] + word[0] + "ay"
	end
end

puts "Ah, you mean '#{pl_word}'!"
